Hello, I'm Sophie. Since the start of my PhD in 2019, I have been researching the implementation of programming languages as part of the [Programming Languages and Systems](https://research.kent.ac.uk/programming-languages-systems/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} Group at [University of Kent (UK)](https://www.kent.ac.uk/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

I am interested in improving the performance of dynamic languages and their associated tooling, analysing their behaviour and runtime to discover new methods of optimisation.

I have just submitted my PhD dissertation, and I am now looking for new professional opportunities revolving around programming languages. I briefly describe my current and past projects in [Projects](/research).
